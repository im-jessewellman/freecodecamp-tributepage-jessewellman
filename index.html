                    In elementary school, in the 5th grade, he graduated out of Special Education classes. One day he went to his class as normal but remembers hearing his classmates murmuring about how helpless they were and how stupid they are. Upon reflection, he knew he must remove himself and applied 100% of his efforts studying whatever was required to graduate. Halfway through the school year, succeeded. Despite struggling the rest of his public schooling career, the experience of graduating out of Special Education left a permanent mark on how he thought of himself and the education system.

                <p>
                    At the age of 18, leaving his family of origin with no contact and simply disappeared. Beginning his van life lifestyle traveling the United States, living out of his car, and working whatever general labor and door to door sales jobs. Holding employment for only a couple of months at a time, continuing his studies programming, he was finding himself.

                    By the age of 23, he was bored being homeless and getting new places to live, so he reflected on his next steps. One step would eventually include an impact on the universe that would revolutionize the employer-employee relationship.

                <h4> The Revolution:</h4>

                    Numerous subreddits and Twitter accounts spread the message, it's most importantly a profitable behavior from an employer and a moral one. Hundreds of thousands of job seekers refused to entertain any employers who attempted to offer anything less. The same ripple effect happened to college tuition costs for universities, students fed up spending hundreds of thousands of dollars they didn't have for higher education. The young generation refused to put up with sub-par standards in both education and occupation conditions. Anything less was unacceptable. It was better to be on welfare and self-study than to entertain wasting away spending energy with employers or universities who didn't care.
